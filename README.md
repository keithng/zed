Zed Data Visualisation Library, Keith Ng
==============================

Version 1.0 (9 Oct 2013)

A challenger to D3, with a focus on animation, complex data structures and integrated data/object model.

Zed's main tool for managing data is the datacube. It's basically a JSON object with built-in OLAP functionality, and can contain unlimited data types in unlimited dimensions (until your computer crashes). Zed's visualisation components are called swarms. Swarms are linked to a datacube and a space, it also contains a plan, which defines rules for rendering drones.
